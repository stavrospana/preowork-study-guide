A study guide for course pre-work.
# Prework Study guide Webpage

## Description

This is the website that I made during the prework course for the Full Stack coding bootcamp. It was honestly pretty challenging and I had a lot of issues on my end that I ended up resolving which was really rewarding! Sometimes I would mess up the spelling on certain files and have to trace my steps backwards and fix them myself or in GitHub I would acddientally merge a branch too soon and have to go back and fix that as well it was a really great learning experience and I enjoyed every step of the way!

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
